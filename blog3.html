    A few months after moving into our house, I discovered a new hobby—if you can call 
    it that—for making elements of my life marginally more streamlined. The interest came 
    around the same time aditi and I were bombarded by a flurry of new responsibilities 
    that included a new house, dog, and garden, not to mention carving out a life for ourselves
    in a new city. I wanted to spend less time with the mundane tasks of everyday life—remembering 
    to buy olive oil, vacuuming—and more time exploring. After joining Gym,
     I set my sights on other small, smart improvements that would make my life just a bit more taken 
     care of.

    Completely innocuous, but annoying nonetheless, was the issue of my hair tools. 
    (I say "issue" here with about as little weight as the word can carry.) 
    Because of the size of our bathroom, which basically holds a tube of mascara,
     I was lugging a basket of hair tools from my closet anytime I wanted to do my hair.
      Enter: The hair drawer.

     Years ago, I saved a post Jacey Duprie wrote on her blog "Damsel in Dior," which
     featured a plug inside of her hair drawer. That post took a seat in my brain as 
     the ultimate possible luxury—being able to do my hair without the tiny inconvenience 
     of plugging in my hair dryer. When it took me all of five minutes to create my own,
      I couldn't believe I'd waited so long to make a plug-in hair drawer. Now, I keep all 
      of my hair tools in the top of the shelves, which has made doing my hair 
      so convenient, I actually do it now.
